//Synchronous Programming-> One by one execute line by line
//in this code in line-2 it will wait for line-1 complete his  execution  and then line-2 will execute and then line-3 will execute


//Asynchronous Programming->
console.log(1);
console.log(2);
console.log(3); 
console.log("API"); 
console.log(4);
console.log(5);

//here from line 1 to 3 running normally just like synchronous way.
//but in line-4 it will wait for line-3 to complete his execution and then line-4 will execute and then line-5 will execute -this is the way
//but in asynchronous programming in line 4 it is taking too much for execution
///let the line 4 run and parallelly line 5 and all code will execute when line 4 executed show its output
